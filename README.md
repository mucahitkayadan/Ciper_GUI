## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
- `ui/`: Contains all the UI files for different screens.
- `html_files/`: Houses HTML files for algorithm descriptions and explanations.
- `engine/`: Contains the core cryptographic implementations.
- `db/`: Database files for user authentication and profiles.
