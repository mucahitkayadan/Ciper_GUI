  <h1>Rail Fence Cipher Overview</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that encrypts and decrypts messages by arranging characters in a zigzag pattern.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>The plaintext is written out in a zigzag pattern across a certain number of "rails" or lines. The ciphertext is then read off from the zigzag pattern.</p>

  <h2>Encrypting</h2>
  <p>To encrypt a message, the sender chooses the number of rails and writes the message in a zigzag pattern accordingly.</p>

  <h2>Decrypting</h2>
  <p>To decrypt, the receiver sets up the same zigzag pattern with the correct number of rails and reads off the message from the pattern.</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>For example, with the message "HELLOWORLD" and 3 rails:</p>
  <pre>
    H   O   L   O   L   W   R   D
     E L W R D
      L   O   L
  </pre>
  <p>The ciphertext would be "HOLELWRDLOL".</p>

  <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
  <p>The Rail Fence Cipher is a simple transposition cipher and is not considered secure for transmitting sensitive information.</p>

  <p>It can be easily broken with techniques like frequency analysis.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Rail Fence Cipher, while interesting in its approach, is not recommended for secure communication. Modern cryptographic methods employ more robust encryption techniques.</p>
