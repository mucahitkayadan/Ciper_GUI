  <h1>Caesar Cipher Overview</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Caesar cipher is a basic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>The shift value, also known as the key, determines the substitution. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.</p>

  <h2>Encryption Process</h2>
  <p>To encrypt a message using the Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted by the chosen key. Spaces and non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.</p>

  <h2>Decryption Process</h2>
  <p>To decrypt, the receiver uses the same key to shift each letter in the opposite direction, effectively reversing the encryption process.</p>

  <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
  <p>The Caesar cipher is vulnerable to brute force attacks, especially due to its limited number of possible keys (the 26 letters of the alphabet).</p>

  <p>It is a relatively weak form of encryption and is not suitable for securing sensitive information.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Caesar cipher is a historical encryption method with a simple mechanism. While it played a role in ancient cryptography, modern applications require more secure encryption techniques.</p>
