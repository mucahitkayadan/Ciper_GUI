  <h1>ROT13 Cipher Overview</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces each letter with the letter 13 positions after it in the alphabet.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>ROT13 operates on the principle of a Caesar cipher with a fixed shift of 13 positions.</p>

  <h2>Encrypting and Decrypting</h2>
  <p>For both encryption and decryption, each letter in the message is shifted by 13 positions. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>For example, applying ROT13 to the message "HELLO" results in the ciphertext "URYYB".</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>ROT13 is often used as a simple method to obscure text while still making it easily reversible. It's commonly employed for spoilers or hiding answers to puzzles on the internet.</p>

  <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
  <p>ROT13 is not a secure encryption method and should not be used for sensitive information. It provides no real cryptographic strength.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>ROT13 is a fun and simple cipher with limited practical use in terms of security. For secure communication, it is recommended to use more advanced cryptographic methods.</p>
