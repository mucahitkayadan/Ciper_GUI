  <h1>Vigenère Cipher History</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Vigenère cipher is a poly-alphabetic substitution cipher introduced by Blaise de Vigenère in the 16th century.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <h3>Substitution Ciphers:</h3>
  <p>Substitution ciphers involve replacing each letter in the plaintext with another letter or symbol.</p>

  <p>The Caesar cipher is a basic substitution cipher where each letter is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.</p>

  <h3>Poly-alphabetic Substitution:</h3>
  <p>The Vigenère cipher is a poly-alphabetic substitution cipher, using multiple substitution alphabets.</p>

  <p>Unlike the Caesar cipher, it uses a keyword to determine the shift for each position in the text.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <h3>Keyed Caesar Ciphers:</h3>
  <p>The Vigenère cipher is multiple Caesar ciphers in sequence, each with a different shift determined by the keyword.</p>

  <p><strong>Encrypting:</strong> To encrypt a message, the sender selects a keyword and repeats it enough times to match the message's length.</p>

  <p>Each letter in the message is shifted according to the corresponding letter in the keyword.</p>

  <p><strong>Decrypting:</strong> To decrypt, the receiver uses the same keyword and shifts each letter in the opposite direction.</p>

  <h2>Historical Context</h2>
  <p>The Vigenère cipher is centuries old and was considered unbreakable for a long time.</p>

  <p>It wasn't until the 19th century that crypto-analysts, such as Charles Babbage and Friedrich Kasiski, developed methods to break poly-alphabetic ciphers like the Vigenère.</p>

  <h2>Cryptanalysis</h2>
  <p>The Vigenère cipher, while more secure than simple substitution ciphers, can still be broken.</p>

  <p>The Kasiski examination and Friedman test are among the methods used for cryptanalysis.</p>

  <p>Despite its vulnerability to modern cryptographic techniques, the Vigenère cipher remains an important historical cipher and a stepping stone in the development of more advanced cryptographic methods.</p>
